# Webpack 4 Configuration

My webpack configuration that I use for small projects. 
I do suggest using this webpack configuration for educational purposes, because I made it specifically for myself.

It has many features that every static website needs.
You may take a look at the configuration itself to see what it is capable of...

As `dependencies` it includes:
- Font Awesome 5 Pro (which you cannot even install if you don't have their Pro account, as you need a token)
- Bootstrap 4
- Popper.js
- jQuery Slim
